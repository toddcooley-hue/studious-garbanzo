# Introduction

A regional liberal arts institution in the Northeast United State is exploring the launch of a **Master of Public Health (MPH)** program. This fully online, synchronous program is designed to serve a diverse set of learners, including current undergraduates (via a 4+1 pathway), recent graduates, and mid-career professionals. This report assesses the viability of such a program across multiple dimensions including labor market demand, competitive landscape, internal feasibility, and audience value propositions.

Note: All institutional data in this report is simulated for illustrative purposes.

# 1. Regional Labor Market Demand

## National Trends

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

mph_jobs <- tibble(
  Role = c("Epidemiologists", "Health Educators", "Community Health Workers", "All Healthcare Jobs", "National Avg"),
  GrowthRate = c(19, 11, 12, 13, 5)  # 5% as average national job growth baseline
)

mph_jobs <- mph_jobs %>%
  mutate(Highlight = ifelse(Role == "National Avg", "Baseline", "Projected"))

ggplot(mph_jobs, aes(x = reorder(Role, GrowthRate), y = GrowthRate, fill = Highlight)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Projected" = "#E69F00", "Baseline" = "#56B4E9")) +
  labs(title = "Projected Job Growth for MPH-Related Roles vs. National Average (2023–2033)",
       x = "Job Role",
       y = "Growth Rate (%)",
       fill = "Legend") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

- Healthcare roles are projected to grow significantly, especially in epidemiology and public health education.
- Pennsylvania’s aging population and growing healthcare industry in the region further enhance regional demand.

## Local Demand: Lehigh Valley

- Regional Health Networks collectively employ over 33,000 workers.
- Regional job growth forecast (2020–2025) exceeds PA average.
- Public and nonprofit sectors show rising demand for health communication, policy, and data roles.

## Earnings Advantage of an MPH

```{r}
earnings <- tibble(
  Education = c("Bachelor's Degree", "MPH Degree"),
  MedianSalary = c(55000, 79000)
)

ggplot(earnings, aes(x = Education, y = MedianSalary, fill = Education)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Bachelor's Degree" = "#56B4E9", "MPH Degree" = "#E69F00")) +
  labs(title = "Median Salary Comparison: Bachelor's vs. MPH Degree",
       y = "Median Salary (USD)",
       x = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

- Individuals with an MPH earn approximately **$24,000 more** annually on average compared to those with only a bachelor’s degree.
- The return on investment makes the $35,000 tuition cost for the MPH program competitive and compelling.

# 6. Conclusion

The proposed MPH program is **highly viable**, given:

- Strong job growth in healthcare and public health roles
- Local demand from Lehigh Valley employers
- Competitive differentiation via liberal arts and synchronous online delivery
- Appealing value propositions for multiple learner segments

With strategic recruitment and CEPH accreditation, Muhlenberg is well-positioned to succeed in launching this new program.
